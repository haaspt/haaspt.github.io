                <h3>Demographics, Politics, and Optimism</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization/">Data Management and Visualization</a> — Week 1</h4>
<p><em>This is the first in a series of posts I’m writing as part o</em>f
<em>Wesleyan University’s online</em> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization/"><em>Data Management and
Visualization</em></a>
<em>course.</em></p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>For this course’s first assignment I decided to take a close look at the
data from the 2012 “<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/data-management-visualization/OutlookOnLife%20Codebook.pdf">Outlook on Life
Surveys</a>”,
published by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research, and conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks.</p>
<p>The survey collected responses from 2,294 respondents on questions
related to their biographical details, social and political views, as
well as their general thoughts on life and the future. Respondents
provided answers to more than 400 questions.</p>
<p>The end result is a rich data set for investigating any number of
socio-political questions.</p>
<h4>Research Focus</h4>
<p>This being an election year, I couldn’t resist the urge to investigate a
deeply political question: how closely does a person’s views on the
country’s future correlate to their political orientation?</p>
<p>Are self-identified liberals more optimistic about continued future
progress, or do they feel we’re on the wrong track and need deep reform?
Do conservatives see an America in decline, or a country bound for
greatness?</p>
<p>Based on casual observation in my personal life, as well as from
following the news, I think that we’ll find a tendency for
self-identified liberals and those with progressive ideologies to be
generally more optimistic about the future (both their own and of the
country as a whole). The affect is likely even more pronounced in this
study because it was conducted in the months leading up to the 2012
presidential election, in which Republicans unsuccessfully attempted to
prevent Barack Obama from winning a second term in the White House.</p>
<p>After I answer this question I plan to introduce further variables
related to the respondents’ demographic information, including gender,
ethnicity, and age. This will show us if outlook shifts significantly
among different demographic groups.</p>
<h4>Literature Review</h4>
<p>While reviewing literature on this subject by both academics and
political thinkers, I found it divided into two major lines of
investigation. The first consists of studies based on surveys reporting
<em>happiness</em> by political party (rather than outlook on the future). And
the other mainly consists of psychological studies arguing whether
deep-seated “fight-or-flight”-type responses affect everyday political
identities.</p>
<p>Articles discussing political affiliation and happiness are easy to come
by and are surprisingly consistent in their conclusions: across the
board Republicans report being happier than Democrats. A 2006 article by
the <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2006/02/13/are-we-happy-yet/">Pew Research
Center</a>
found that 45% of Republicans said they were “very happy” versus just
30% of Democrats.</p>
<p>Curious to see if this trend was consistent over time I grabbed some
data from the <a href="http://gss.norc.org/">General Social Survey</a> and it turns
out that yes, for over 40 years Democrats have on average trailed
Republicans by a consistent margin in self-reported happiness.</p>
<p><img alt="A chart I created using data from the GSS. Respondents were asked to
rate their happiness from 0 meaning “not too happy” to 2 meaning
“very happy.”" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1z3bmVjydBChTcH9BMIJ2g.png"></p>
<p>Arthur Brooks, President of the conservative think tank the American
Enterprise Institute, coincidentally <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2008/04/23/conservatives-are-happier-than-liberals-discuss/">used this same exact
data</a>
to tease people like me who, perhaps naïvely, assume that liberals are
the naturally happy sort.</p>
<p>Digging deeper into this line of research on the academic side, Jaime
Napier and John Jost, in a study titled “<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=w0SkCAIAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=w0SkCAIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">Why are conservatives happier
than
liberals?</a>”,
posit that the happiness gap is in part due to rising wealth inequality.
Their research finds that the ability to rationalize and insulate
oneself from that inequality plays a crucial role in conservatives’
ability to maintain higher average happiness.</p>
<p>If Napier and Jost are correct then we should expect to see those
effects at play in our question. While they focused on happiness, rather
than on subjects’ outlook on the future, it would follow that
conservatives’ ability to better rationalize socio-economic ills would
leave them with a better outlook on their future as well as that of the
country.</p>
<p>But it’s not quite that simple.</p>
<p>If we turn to psychological research we find another consistent trend:
conservative political leanings correlate strongly to a higher than
average aversion to uncertainty. Put simply, conservatives have a
stronger fight-or-flight reflex than their liberal counterparts.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=w0SkCAIAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=w0SkCAIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C">study in the <em>Personality and Social Psychology
Bulletin</em></a>
** found that “avoidance of uncertainty” and “threat management” both
contribute independently to conservative political beliefs.</p>
<p>These findings aren’t unique. Recent articles in
<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5896/1667.short"><em>Science</em></a>
and <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9292100"><em>Behavioral and Brain
Sciences</em></a>
** cite a growing body of research strongly linking conservatives with
greater psychological responses to the unknown. Together they advance
the notion that political ideologies may be more deeply rooted in our
physiology than we have traditionally assumed.</p>
<p>This second line of research may be significant for the research I am
planning because the question we’re looking at not only considers
current happiness, but also people’s responses to future unknowns. These
factors may come into play with our analysis.</p>
<p>We’ll see what the data has to say.</p>
